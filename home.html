            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p>
                This is my very first actual website. Congrats on making it here. I imagine you must be one of the graders or something if you're here. But welcome regardless. This is for my class that I'll be starting in a few days - creating this website on what I wanted. So this is going to be a mix up about me. :D

            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>
                Well that's a pretty rude question. You didn't see me asking who you were did you? I'll tell you but since you asked in such a rude fashion, I won't tell you everything. Rude.

                That's a Drake lyric and I think it's pretty funny to retort when introducing myself. My name is RudyTaB00TY (that's my gamertag) and I like to play video games! I love to actualy, great hobby I have. I'm learning how to code, hence the website and I love basketball. I used to play up until college. I right ACL, after tearing my left in high school, and decided I was done. I wouldn't be able to bounce back fully from it, and I didn't. I watch the game though, but not men's. I like women's basketball, and I watch the best of the best - the WNBA. One of my best decisions was deciding to watch the WNBA. I love the game. I love women. Put two and two together and you get an amazing time.

            <h2>Why is this so ugly?</h2>
            <p>
                I am appaled at this treatment. Listen, I dont know who you are but have some respect please. Everybody starts somewhere and this is where I'm starting. Maybe in like a year or so I'll make another webiste like this and see how well I can make it. A bit of compare and contrast. I have no doubt it will be 100 times better. But until then, we're all stuck with this ugly piece of sh-

                Can I curse? I imagine I can but I have a fear that I'll curse and I'll get some type of strike or shit on my record. Guess I'll find out ;)
